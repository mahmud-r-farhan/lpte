# LPTE Roadmap

## Current Release — v1.2.0 (shipped)

**Performance**
- [x] `str.translate` bulk character mapping — 7.5× faster on long text
- [x] SymSpell-style delete-1 fuzzy index — O(word length) not O(vocabulary)
- [x] Indexed suffix tables (bucketed by final character)
- [x] Memoized Unicode categories and stemming
- [x] Threshold-free cache keys (one entry serves every threshold)
- [x] Script routing for mixed-script text

**Correctness**
- [x] Context-rule coverage rule — a benign word elsewhere no longer masks a real violation
- [x] Sentence-final `!` no longer turns `ass!` into `assi` (was hiding matches)
- [x] Sanitize masks obfuscated surface forms (`f4ck`, `f.u.c.k`, `f u c k`, `shiiit`)
- [x] Sentence-final `!`/`+` treated as punctuation, not leetspeak
- [x] HTML entity handling — no double-unescaping
- [x] Deterministic `matched_terms` ordering (no set-iteration leakage)

**Real-world features**
- [x] Content categories: `profanity` / `insult` / `sexual` / `slur` / `threat`
- [x] Severity calibration — slurs/threats escalate, swearing/insults capped at HIGH
- [x] Moderation policies with ALLOW / FLAG / MASK / BLOCK actions
- [x] Harm-weighted decisions (same confidence, different consequence)
- [x] Multi-language engine for code-switched chat (Banglish / Hinglish)
- [x] Async API (`analyze_async`, `batch_analyze_async`)
- [x] `lpte` CLI: analyze / sanitize / batch / validate / languages / bench
- [x] 313 tests (from 148)

**Language data fixes**
- [x] Bengali: removed bare possessives (`মায়ের` = "mother's") that flagged
      ordinary sentences like "my mother's cooking is lovely"
- [x] Bengali: removed religious identity words (`হিন্দু`, `মুসলিম`)
- [x] Bengali: removed `দুধ` ("milk"); allowlisted benign collocations
- [x] English: replaced bare `kill` with targeted threat phrases
- [x] English: added bullying/insult vocabulary and context rules
